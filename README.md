# Incidents Bot (Rails API)

This is a **Rails API** service that integrates with **Microsoft Teams** (via **Azure Bot Service**) to support **incident tracking**.  
It listens for Teams activities, responds with text or Adaptive Cards, and can send proactive notifications when incidents change state.

---

## Features

- Receive chat messages from Teams users  
- JWT validation against Microsoft Bot Framework  
- Respond with Adaptive Cards (create form, incident list)  
- Handle card submissions (`invoke` activities)  
- Store incidents in PostgreSQL  
- Proactively notify conversations when incidents update
